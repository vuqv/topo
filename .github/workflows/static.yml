# Deploy Sphinx documentation to GitHub Pages.
# Required: In the repo go to Settings → Pages → Build and deployment,
# and set "Source" to "GitHub Actions". Otherwise this workflow will fail with "Get Pages site failed".
#
# The site must contain index.html at the root. This workflow builds docs in docs/
# and uploads docs/_build/html so the deployed site has index.html and the full doc tree.
